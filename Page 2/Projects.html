                    <h3>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h3>
                    <p>This is the first page I made using React.js. It's a simple game that I believe most people have played when they were younger, tic-tac-toe or X & O's. It holds the abiilty to each step of the game giving the users the option to see each move step by step or in what ever order they want.</p>

                    <p>This project was undertaken by a team consisting of me and two others, and we worked to determine which neighbourhood in the city of Pittsburgh was the best to live in. We determined this through air quality data and police incident reports. All the data used was from the city's publicly available database</p>
