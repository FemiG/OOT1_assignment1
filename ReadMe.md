I created a personal portfolio website. The purpose is to introduce myself, showcase my skills, projects, and resume, and provide ways for others (like employers or collaborators) to contact me. This type of website is useful for professional branding and job applications.

### Home Page (index.html)

Landing page introducing the site with navigation links to the other pages.
Includes visuals and JavaScript functionality for interactive elements.

### About Me Page (Page 1/About_me.html)

Contains information about my background, interests, and experience.
Uses semantic tags like <'section> and <'p> to organize content.

### Projects Page (Page 2/Projects.html)

Displays a gallery of projects I’ve worked on.
Uses images with descriptions to highlight my portfolio.

### Resume Page (Page 3/Resume.html)

Provides a summary of my professional background.
Includes a link to download/view my CV.

### Contact Page (Page 4/Contact.html)

Has a contact information where users can contact me.
Encourages networking and feedback.

## JavaScript Interactivity
I wrote three scripts to add interactivity:
